title: WhatsApp Setup
description: Connect your WhatsApp Business Account to Pons.
---

## Prerequisites

- A [Meta Business Account](https://business.facebook.com/)
- A [Meta Developer Account](https://developers.facebook.com/)
- A phone number for WhatsApp Business (can be a test number from Meta)

## 1. Create a Meta Business App

1. Go to [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) and create a new app
2. Select **Business** as the app type
3. Add the **WhatsApp** product to your app

## 2. Get your credentials

From the WhatsApp product page in your Meta app, you'll need:

| Credential | Where to find it |
|:-----------|:-----------------|
| **WABA ID** | WhatsApp > Getting Started > WhatsApp Business Account ID |
| **Phone Number ID** | WhatsApp > Getting Started > Phone number ID |
| **Access Token** | WhatsApp > Getting Started > Temporary access token (or create a permanent System User token) |
| **App Secret** | App Settings > Basic > App Secret |

### Permanent Access Token

The temporary token from the Getting Started page expires after 24 hours. For production:

1. Go to **Business Settings** > **System Users**
2. Create a System User with **Admin** access
3. Assign the WhatsApp Business Account
4. Generate a token with `whatsapp_business_management` and `whatsapp_business_messaging` permissions

## 3. Create an Account in Pons

1. Sign in to [pons.chat](https://pons.chat) with Google
2. Click **Setup Account** (or the + button if you already have accounts)
3. Fill in:
   - **Account Name** — a friendly name (e.g., "My Business")
   - **WABA ID** — WhatsApp Business Account ID
   - **Phone Number ID** — from Meta dashboard
   - **Phone Number** — your WhatsApp number (e.g., +1 555 123 4567)
   - **Access Token** — your permanent token
   - **App Secret** — for webhook signature verification
   - **Webhook Verify Token** — auto-generated, you'll need this for Meta

## 4. Configure the Webhook

1. Copy the **Webhook URL** shown after creating your account: `https://pons.chat/api/webhook`
2. Copy the **Webhook Verify Token**
3. In Meta Developer Console, go to WhatsApp > Configuration > Webhook
4. Paste the callback URL and verify token
5. Click **Verify and Save**
6. Subscribe to the `messages` webhook field

## 5. Test it

Send a message to your WhatsApp Business number from any phone. You should see it appear in the Pons dashboard in real-time.

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook not receiving messages

- Ensure you subscribed to the `messages` field in Meta webhook configuration
- Check that your App Secret is correct (used for signature verification)
- Verify the webhook URL is `https://pons.chat/api/webhook` (no trailing slash)

### "Access token expired" errors

- Use a permanent System User token instead of the temporary one
- Ensure the token has `whatsapp_business_messaging` permission

### Messages not showing in dashboard

- Check that the Phone Number ID in Pons matches the one in Meta
- Ensure you're looking at the correct account in the account switcher
