description: Bridge the WhatsApp Business Cloud API to any MCP-compatible client.
---

**Pons** (_Latin for "bridge"_) connects WhatsApp to the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/), so your AI assistant can read, search, and send WhatsApp messages as naturally as it reads files or searches the web.

## What Pons does

- **Full WhatsApp inbox** — real-time web UI with conversations, media, delivery receipts
- **MCP server** — expose WhatsApp as tools for Claude Desktop, Cursor, or any MCP client
- **Multi-tenant** — multiple WhatsApp Business Accounts, multiple users per account
- **Media handling** — images, videos, documents auto-downloaded to storage (Meta URLs expire in 5 min)
- **24h window tracking** — know when you can send free-form vs. template-only messages
- **API key management** — scoped keys for different clients with expiration

## Quick Start

1. **Sign in** at [pons.chat](https://pons.chat) with Google
2. **Create an Account** with your WhatsApp Business credentials
3. **Set your webhook** in the Meta developer console
4. **Create an API key** and connect your MCP client
