description: Create and manage scoped API keys for MCP access.

## Overview

API keys authenticate MCP clients to your Pons account. Each key is scoped to specific permissions and tied to a single WhatsApp Business Account.

## Creating a Key

1. Sign in to [pons.chat](https://pons.chat)
2. Click the **key icon** (🔑) in the top navigation
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Enter a name (e.g., "Claude Desktop", "Cursor", "Monitoring")
5. Select the scopes:
   - **read** — view conversations, messages, templates
   - **write** — mark as read, send reactions
   - **send** — send text and template messages
6. Click **Create**
7. **Copy the key immediately** — it will not be shown again

## Key Format

Keys follow the format: `pons_` followed by a random string.

```
pons_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

## Using a Key

Pass the key as a Bearer token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer pons_your_api_key_here
```

In MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pons": {
      "url": "https://pons.chat/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer pons_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Scopes

| Scope | Tools | Description |
|:------|:------|:------------|
| **read** | `list_conversations`, `list_unanswered`, `get_conversation`, `search_messages`, `list_templates` | View data only |
| **write** | `mark_as_read`, `send_reaction` | Modify message state |
| **send** | `send_text`, `send_template`, `send_media` | Send messages to contacts |

### Recommended scope combinations

- **Read-only monitoring:** `read`
- **Full assistant access:** `read` + `write` + `send`
- **Send-only automation:** `read` + `send` (needs read to look up conversations)

## Revoking a Key

1. Open the API Key Manager (key icon in the nav)
2. Click the **trash icon** next to the key you want to revoke
3. Confirm deletion

Revoked keys are immediately invalidated. Any MCP client using that key will receive authentication errors.

## Security

- Keys are hashed before storage — we cannot retrieve your key after creation
- Each key is tied to a specific account — it cannot access other accounts
- Keys work across all users who are members of the account
- Rotate keys regularly, especially if a client is decommissioned
