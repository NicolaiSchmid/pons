[OpenCode](https://github.com/nicepkg/opencode) is a terminal-based AI coding assistant that supports MCP. With Pons, you can access your WhatsApp Business messages without leaving the terminal — search conversations, check who's waiting for a reply, and send messages.

This guide takes about 3 minutes.

## Prerequisites

- [OpenCode](https://github.com/nicepkg/opencode) installed
- A Pons account at [pons.chat](https://pons.chat) with at least one WhatsApp Business number connected ([setup guide](/docs/whatsapp-setup))

## Step 1: Create an API key

1. Sign in to [pons.chat](https://pons.chat)
2. Click the **key icon** to open the API Key Manager
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Name it "OpenCode" and select the scopes you need:
   - **read** — list conversations, search messages
   - **write** — mark messages as read, send reactions
   - **send** — send text and template messages
5. Copy the key

## Step 2: Configure OpenCode

Edit `~/.config/opencode/config.json` and add Pons to the MCP section:

```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "pons": {
      "type": "remote",
      "url": "https://pons.chat/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer pons_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `pons_your_api_key_here` with your API key.

## Step 3: Restart OpenCode

OpenCode reads MCP configuration on startup. Restart it to pick up the new server.

## Step 4: Use it

Ask OpenCode:

> "List my WhatsApp conversations"

It'll call the `list_conversations` tool and return your recent chats.

More things you can do:

- "Who's waiting for a WhatsApp reply?"
- "Search my WhatsApp for 'deployment'"
- "Send 'Done, it's deployed' to +49123456789"
- "What did the last message from Alex say?"

## Why WhatsApp in the terminal?

If you're a developer who spends most of the day in a terminal, checking WhatsApp means context-switching to your phone or a browser tab. With Pons + OpenCode, you can quickly check and reply to business messages without leaving your workflow.

It's especially useful for:
- **Quick triage** — "show me unanswered WhatsApp messages" between git commits
- **Searching** — find that API key or tracking number someone sent you over WhatsApp
- **Automated replies** — let the AI draft a response and send it after your approval

## Scoped keys for safety

If you only want to read messages from OpenCode (no sending), create a key with just the `read` scope. OpenCode will be able to list and search conversations but not send anything. See the [API Keys guide](/docs/api-keys) for more.
