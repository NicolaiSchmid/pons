ChatGPT supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, which means you can connect it to external tools — including your WhatsApp Business inbox. With Pons, ChatGPT can list your conversations, search messages, and send replies.

## Prerequisites

- A ChatGPT Plus or Team subscription (MCP requires a paid plan)
- A Pons account at [pons.chat](https://pons.chat) with a WhatsApp Business number connected ([setup guide](/docs/whatsapp-setup))

## Step 1: Create an API key

1. Sign in to [pons.chat](https://pons.chat)
2. Click the **key icon** to open the API Key Manager
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Name it "ChatGPT" and select your scopes:
   - **read** — list conversations, search messages
   - **write** — mark as read, reactions
   - **send** — send messages
5. Copy the key

## Step 2: Add Pons as an MCP server in ChatGPT

1. Open ChatGPT and go to **Settings**
2. Navigate to the **MCP Servers** section
3. Click **Add Server**
4. Enter the details:
   - **Name:** Pons
   - **URL:** `https://pons.chat/api/mcp`
   - **Authentication:** Bearer token — paste your `pons_` API key

## Step 3: Use it

Start a new conversation and ask:

> "List my WhatsApp conversations"

ChatGPT will use the Pons tools to fetch your conversations and display them.

More examples:

- "Who hasn't gotten a reply on WhatsApp?"
- "Search my WhatsApp messages for 'meeting tomorrow'"
- "Send 'On my way' to +49123456789"
- "What templates do I have available?"

## Things to know

**ChatGPT remembers context.** You can have a conversation like: "Show me unanswered messages" → "Reply to the first one saying 'I'll check and get back to you'" — and ChatGPT will use the conversation ID from the first response.

**Scopes control access.** If you created a read-only key, ChatGPT can browse your conversations but can't send messages. This is useful if you want to use ChatGPT for analysis without giving it write access.

**The 24-hour window matters.** If a conversation's window is closed, ChatGPT will need to use `send_template` instead of `send_text`. Pons includes window status in the conversation data, so ChatGPT knows which to use.

## Use cases

- **Daily summary** — "Summarize my unread WhatsApp Business messages"
- **Customer triage** — "Which WhatsApp conversations need a response? Draft replies for each."
- **Search** — "Find any WhatsApp messages about the order #12345"
- **Template sending** — "Send the welcome template to this list of phone numbers"
