Two billion people use WhatsApp. If your customers are among them, you've probably thought about using AI to handle — or at least help with — support conversations. But most WhatsApp AI solutions are either expensive SaaS platforms or brittle chatbot builders.

With Pons and MCP, you can connect any AI model to your WhatsApp Business inbox with fine-grained access control. No chatbot builder, no per-message fees, no vendor lock-in.

## The architecture

Here's how it works:

1. **Pons** receives WhatsApp messages via Meta's Cloud API webhook
2. Messages are stored in your database with real-time sync to the inbox UI
3. **MCP tools** expose these messages to any connected AI agent
4. The AI agent uses tools like `list_unanswered`, `search_messages`, and `send_text` to interact with conversations
5. **API key scopes** control what the agent can do

The key insight is that MCP gives the AI agent the same capabilities a human support agent would have — listing conversations, reading messages, searching history, and sending replies — but through a programmatic interface.

## Three levels of automation

### Level 1: Triage and summarization (read-only)

The safest starting point. Create an API key with only the **read** scope and connect it to your AI assistant.

Ask it things like:
- "Which WhatsApp conversations need a reply?"
- "Summarize the last 10 unanswered messages"
- "Categorize today's WhatsApp messages by topic"
- "Are there any urgent messages about order issues?"

The AI can read everything but can't send anything. You stay in full control of replies.

### Level 2: Draft and send with approval (read + write + send)

Give the agent full access but use it interactively. The AI drafts a reply, you review it, and then approve the send.

A typical workflow:
1. "Show me unanswered WhatsApp messages"
2. AI lists 5 conversations
3. "Draft replies for each"
4. AI proposes responses based on conversation context
5. You review and say "Send the reply to conversation 1 and 3, skip the rest"

This works well with Claude Desktop or Cursor where you're actively in the conversation with the AI.

### Level 3: Autonomous handling

For this, you'd build a script or agent loop that:
1. Calls `list_unanswered` periodically
2. Reads each conversation with `get_conversation`
3. Generates a response
4. Sends it via `send_text` or `send_template`

You can build this with any MCP client SDK. Pons uses Streamable HTTP transport, so a simple HTTP client works too:

```bash
curl -X POST https://pons.chat/api/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pons_your_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "list_unanswered"}}'
```

## The 24-hour window

WhatsApp's rules matter here. When a customer messages you, a **24-hour window** opens. During this window, you can send free-form text with `send_text`. After the window closes, you can only send pre-approved **template messages** with `send_template`.

Pons tracks this automatically. When your AI agent calls `list_conversations` or `list_unanswered`, the response includes the window status for each conversation:

- `[24h window open]` — free-form messaging available
- `[window closed — template required]` — only templates allowed

A well-configured AI agent will check this and choose the right tool automatically.

## Scoped access for safety

API key scopes are your safety net:

| Scope | What the agent can do |
|:------|:---------------------|
| **read** | List conversations, search messages, view templates |
| **write** | Mark messages as read, send emoji reactions |
| **send** | Send text messages and templates |

Create different keys for different purposes:
- A **read-only** key for a monitoring dashboard
- A **read + write** key for a triage agent that marks messages as read
- A **full-access** key for an agent that can reply to customers

If an agent only needs to categorize and summarize incoming messages, give it a read-only key. If it misbehaves, it literally cannot send anything.

## Practical tips

**Start with Level 1.** Get comfortable with the AI reading your conversations before letting it send. You'll learn what it gets right and where it needs guidance.

**Use conversation context.** When the AI calls `get_conversation`, it gets the full message history. This helps it draft contextually appropriate replies instead of generic responses.

**Templates for first contact.** If a customer's 24-hour window is closed, the AI should use `send_template` with an appropriate template. Create a few versatile templates in Meta Business Suite — "Thanks for reaching out, we'll get back to you shortly" goes a long way.

**Search is powerful.** `search_messages` does full-text search across all conversations. Your AI agent can find past interactions: "What did we tell this customer about their refund last time?"

## Getting started

1. [Set up Pons](/docs) with your WhatsApp Business number
2. Create an API key with the scopes you need
3. Connect your preferred AI client ([Claude Desktop](/blog/connect-claude-desktop-to-whatsapp), [OpenCode](/blog/connect-opencode-to-whatsapp), [Cursor](/blog/connect-cursor-to-whatsapp), or [ChatGPT](/blog/connect-chatgpt-to-whatsapp))
4. Start with read-only triage and work your way up
