[Cursor](https://cursor.sh) is an AI-powered code editor that supports MCP servers. With Pons, you can check WhatsApp Business messages, search conversations, and send quick replies — all from within your editor.

## Prerequisites

- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) installed
- A Pons account at [pons.chat](https://pons.chat) with a WhatsApp Business number connected ([setup guide](/docs/whatsapp-setup))

## Step 1: Create an API key

1. Sign in to [pons.chat](https://pons.chat)
2. Click the **key icon** to open the API Key Manager
3. Click **Create Key** with the scopes you need
4. Copy the key

## Step 2: Configure Cursor

You have two options:

### Option A: Cursor Settings UI

1. Open **Cursor Settings** → **MCP Servers**
2. Click **Add Server**
3. Fill in:
   - **Type:** HTTP
   - **URL:** `https://pons.chat/api/mcp`
   - **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer pons_your_api_key_here`

### Option B: Project config file

Create `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pons": {
      "url": "https://pons.chat/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer pons_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The project config approach is useful if you want Pons available only in specific projects. Use the Settings UI for global access.

## Step 3: Use it

In Cursor's AI chat, ask:

> "Check my WhatsApp messages"

Cursor will call the Pons tools and show your recent conversations.

More examples:

- "Any unanswered WhatsApp messages?"
- "Search WhatsApp for 'bug report'"
- "Reply to that conversation with 'Fix is deployed, can you test?'"
- "Send the status update template to +49123456789"

## Why WhatsApp in your editor?

If you're building a product and your customers or team communicate via WhatsApp, having access inside your editor means fewer context switches. Get a bug report on WhatsApp, find the relevant code, fix it, and reply "deployed" — all without leaving Cursor.

## Scopes

Create a minimal key for your use case:

- **Just reading:** `read` scope only — browse conversations, search messages
- **Reading + reacting:** `read` + `write` scopes — also mark as read and react with emoji
- **Full access:** all three scopes — includes sending messages

See the [API Keys guide](/docs/api-keys) for details on scopes and key management.
