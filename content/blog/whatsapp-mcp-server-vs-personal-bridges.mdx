MCP (Model Context Protocol) is making it easy to connect AI assistants to external services. For WhatsApp, several MCP servers have appeared — but they take fundamentally different approaches. Understanding the difference matters because one approach can get your WhatsApp account banned.

## Two approaches to WhatsApp + MCP

### Personal WhatsApp bridges

Projects like [lharries/whatsapp-mcp](https://github.com/lharries/whatsapp-mcp) and similar tools connect to **personal WhatsApp** by reverse-engineering the WhatsApp Web protocol (usually via libraries like Baileys or whatsmeow). They scan a QR code to link your personal account, then expose your messages as MCP tools.

**How it works:** The bridge acts as a WhatsApp Web client. It connects to WhatsApp's servers using an unofficial protocol, receives your personal messages, and lets the AI read and send through your personal number.

**Pros:**
- Works with your personal WhatsApp number
- No Meta developer account needed
- No webhook setup
- Access to personal chats and groups

**Cons:**
- **Violates WhatsApp's Terms of Service** — your account can be permanently banned
- Fragile — breaks when WhatsApp updates their protocol
- No business features (templates, delivery receipts, read receipts in API)
- Single account only
- No official support or stability guarantees

### Cloud API approach (Pons)

Pons connects to **WhatsApp Business** through Meta's official Cloud API. Messages flow through Meta's servers via webhooks, and everything is done through documented, supported endpoints.

**How it works:** You create a WhatsApp Business Account, register a webhook URL, and Meta sends you events (messages, status updates). You send messages through Meta's Graph API. Pons wraps all of this in a web UI and MCP server.

**Pros:**
- **Official API** — no Terms of Service violations, no ban risk
- Business features: templates, delivery receipts, read receipts, media
- Multi-number support (multiple WhatsApp Business numbers)
- Team management (multiple users per account)
- Stable — API changes are versioned and documented
- Full MCP server with scoped API keys

**Cons:**
- Requires a Meta Business Account and developer setup
- Only works with WhatsApp Business numbers, not personal
- Meta's per-conversation pricing (fractions of a cent in most markets)
- Initial setup is more involved (webhook, app secret, phone number ID)

## The ban risk is real

WhatsApp actively detects and bans accounts using unofficial protocols. This isn't theoretical — there are forums full of people who lost their WhatsApp accounts (and all their message history) because they used an unofficial integration.

For personal use, the risk might be acceptable to some. For business use, it's not. If your WhatsApp Business number gets banned, your customers can't reach you.

## Feature comparison

| Feature | Personal Bridges | Pons (Cloud API) |
|:--------|:----------------|:-----------------|
| Ban risk | High | None |
| Personal chats | Yes | No |
| Business number | No | Yes |
| Multiple numbers | No | Yes |
| Team access | No | Yes |
| Message templates | No | Yes |
| Delivery receipts | No | Yes |
| Read receipts | Limited | Yes |
| Media handling | Basic | Auto-download + storage |
| MCP tools | Varies (2-5) | 9 tools with scoped access |
| API key scopes | No | Yes (read/write/send) |
| Web inbox UI | No | Yes |
| Self-hostable | Yes | Yes |

## When to use what

**Use a personal bridge if:**
- You only need read access to personal messages for local experimentation
- You accept the ban risk
- You don't need business features

**Use Pons if:**
- You're using WhatsApp for business communication
- You need team access or multiple numbers
- You want a web inbox alongside MCP
- You need reliable, long-term operation
- You want scoped API keys and access control

## MCP tools comparison

Most personal bridges expose 2-3 tools:

```
- search_contacts
- get_messages
- send_message
```

Pons exposes 9 tools across three permission scopes:

**Read:** `list_conversations`, `list_unanswered`, `get_conversation`, `search_messages`, `list_templates`

**Write:** `mark_as_read`, `send_reaction`

**Send:** `send_text`, `send_template`

The scope system means you can create a read-only API key for an AI that should only browse conversations, and a separate key with send access for an agent that replies to customers.

## Getting started with Pons

If you're currently using a personal bridge and want to switch to the official Cloud API:

1. **Create a Meta Business Account** at [business.facebook.com](https://business.facebook.com)
2. **Create a Meta App** at [developers.facebook.com](https://developers.facebook.com) and add WhatsApp
3. **Sign up at [pons.chat](https://pons.chat)** and add your WhatsApp Business credentials
4. **Configure your webhook** to point to Pons
5. **Create an API key** and connect your MCP client

The [WhatsApp setup guide](/docs/whatsapp-setup) walks through each step. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.
